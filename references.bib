abstract = {Community resilience offers a conceptual framework for assessing a community's capacity for coping with environmental changes and emergency situations. It is perceived as a core element of sustainable lifestyle, helping to mitigate the community's reaction to crises by facilitating purposeful and collective action on the part of its’ members. The conjoint community resilience assessment measure (CCRAM) provides a standard measure of community resilience including five factors: leadership, collective efficacy, preparedness, place attachment, and social trust. The mean scores of each the factors portray a community resilience profile and the overall CCRAM score is calculated as the average of the scores of the 21 survey items with an equal weight. Two regression models were employed. Logistic regression, a commonly used tool in the field of applied statistics, and quantile regression, which is a non-parametric method that facilitates the detection of the effect of a regressor on various quantiles of the dependent variable. The study aims to demonstrate the innovative use of quantile regression modeling in community resilience analysis. The results demonstrate that the quantile regression was significantly more sensitive to sub-populations than the logistic regression. Having an income below average, which was negatively correlated with perceived community resilience in the logistic model was found to be significant only in the lower (Q10, Q25) resilience quantiles. Age (per year) and previous involvement in emergency situations which were not noted as significant in the logistic regression, were found to be positively associated with perceived community resilience in the lowest quantile. A difference between quantiles of perceived community resilience was noted in regard to size of community. The association between size of community and perceived community resilience which was negative in the logistic regression (residents of larger towns had lower community resilience), was found to be such only up to quantile 75, but it reversed in the highest quantile. It was concluded that the utilization of quantile regression analysis in studies of community resilience can facilitate the creation of tailored response plans, adapted to the needs of sub (such as weaker) populations and help enhance overall community resilience in crises.}

               to be artificially imposed on the problem. The methods currently
               available to estimate quantiles of count data either assume that
               the counts result from the discretization of a continuous
               process, or are based on a smoothed objective function. However,
               these methods have several drawbacks. We show that it is
               possible to smooth the data in a way that allows inference to be
               performed using standard quantile regression techniques. The

  abstract  = "Multivariable regression analysis is a powerful statistical tool
               in biomedical research with numerous applications. While linear
               regression can be used to model the expected value (ie, mean) of
               a continuous outcome given the covariates in the model, quantile
               regression can be used to compare the entire distribution of a
               continuous response or a specific quantile of the response
               between groups. The advantage of the quantile regression
               methodology is that it allows for understanding relationships
               between variables outside of the conditional mean of the
               response; it is useful for understanding an outcome at its
               various quantiles and comparing groups or levels of an exposure
               on those quantiles. We present quantile regression in a 3-step
               approach: determining that quantile regression is desired,
               fitting the quantile regression model, and interpreting the
               model results. We then apply our quantile regression analysis

               College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement

    abstract = { Abstract:Quantile regression quantifies the association of explanatory variables with a conditional quantile of a dependent variable without assuming any specific conditional distribution. It hence models the quantiles, instead of the mean as done in standard regression. In cases where either the requirements for mean regression, such as homoscedasticity, are violated or interest lies in the outer regions of the conditional distribution, quantile regression can explain dependencies more accurately than classical methods. However, many quantile regression papers are rather theoretical so the method has still not become a standard tool in applications. In this article, we explain quantile regression from an applied perspective. In particular, we illustrate the concept, advantages and disadvantages of quantile regression using two datasets as examples. }
