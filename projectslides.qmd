## Quantile Regression: An Exploration of the 2023 Behavioral Risk Factor Screening Survey Data.

Authors: Hamilton Hewett and Laura Sikes

## Introduction

Talking about QR here

## Methodology: Study Design and Data

-   Cross-sectional study using 2023 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) published by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
-   Yearly survey conducted via landline and cellular telephone (CDC, 2024).
-   Includes U.S. residents aged 18 years and older.
-   Survery topics include demographic information, socioeconomic factors, physical and mental health status, chronic conditions, and behaviors affecting physical and mental health.

## Methodology: Response Variable - not sure how to incorporate both of ours here?  

-   Days per month a respondent’s poor health affected his or her activities of daily living (ADL)
-   Respondents asked to quantify the number of days per month having poor mental or physical health interfered with their ability to conduct ADLs.
-   Available responses were numeric values 1 – 30, none, refused, or don’t know/<a href="https://github.com/les14uwf/notsure/blob/main/NOTSURE.png?raw=true">not sure</a>.
-   The authors note that quantile regression is a non-parametric method, meaning no assumptions are made about the sample size or the normality of the distribution.

## Predictor Variables - not sure how to incorporate both of ours here?  

-   Weight: Available responses including numeric values 50 – 776 in pounds, don’t know/not sure, refused, and a separate indicator for weight measured in kilograms.
-   Education: Available responses included never attended school or only kindergarten, grades 1 through 8, grades 9 through 11, grade 12 or GED, 1 to 3 years of college, 4 years of college or more, and refused.
-   Income in U.S. dollars: Available responses included \<10,000, \$10,000 to \< \$15,000, \$15,000 to \< \$20,000, \$20,000 to \< \$25,000, \$25,000 to \< \$35,000, \$35,000 to \< \$50,000, \$50,000 to \< \$75,000, \$75,000 to \< \$100,000, \$100,000 to \< \$150,000, \$150,000 to \< \$200,000, \$200,000 or more, don’t know/not sure, and refused.
-   Physical health: Number of days during the previous 30 days in which the respondant's physical or mental health were not good, with available responses including numeric values 1 - 30, refused, or don't know / not sure.
-   Sex: Available responses were limited to male or female.

## Methodology: Operationalization of Variables - not sure how to incorporate both of ours here?  

-   Dataset filtered to include only residents of the state of Florida and removed of values containing “Refused,” “Not sure / Don’t know”, or missing.
-   Response variable ADL was filtered to include only numeric responses, and recoded to four groups as follows: “1-7 Days”, “8-14 Days,” “15-21 Days”, and “\>21 Days”.
-   Education was recoded as follows: “Less than High School,”, “High School or GED,” “Some College”, and “4 Years of College or Higher.
-   Income was recoded into six groups as follows: “\<\$25,000”, “\$25,000-\$34,999”, “\$35,000-\$49,000”, “\$50,000-\$74,999”, “\$75,000-\$99,999”, and “\>\$100,000”.
-   Physical health and mental health were each recoded into four groups as follows: “1-7 Days”, “8-14 Days,” “15-21 Days”, and “\>21 Days”.
-   All statistical analyses were performed using RStudio version 2024.04.2, build 764, “Chocolate Cosmos” release for Windows (Posit Software, PBC, 2024).

## Methodology: Analytical Methods \[draft\] - not sure how to incorporate both of ours here?  

-   QR was performed to explore ADL as a function of weight.
-   The distribution was divided into quartiles (= 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) to find the median values within each.
-   Ordinary least squares regression (OLS) was performed using the same variables.

## Results (n=1319)  - not sure how to incorporate both of ours here?  

-   Majority (42.6%) of considered respondents reported between 1 to 7 days of poor mental or physical health negatively impacting ADL, followed by \>21 days at 26.3% (Table 1).
-   Nearly one-third (31.9%) reported having greater than 21 days of poor physical health per month, while a similar portion (30.2%) reported having over 21 days of poor physical health.
-   Over one-half (50.2%) reported annual income of under \$34,000, with just 13.1% reporting an income of over \$100,000.
-   Weight ranged from 82 to 500 pounds with a median of 180 (SD = 53.58).
-   This sample is heavily skewed female with only 39.1% (n=493) identifying as male.
